# scraper
A web scraper/crawler written in Python. It is fairly simple, but oh so sweet.

#It was written in Python 2 and uses:
<ol type = "i">
<li>Beautiful Soup</li>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>PyQuery</li>
</ol>
I should note that PyQuery was used to make a mirror of the first scraper, which uses Beautiful Soup.

#New Addition: WikiCapture.py
Written for python 3+

You will need:
<ol type="i">
<li>BeautifulSoup</li>
<li>Requests</li>
</ol>

Just run the script in the commandline, like you would any other, and be sure to enter names like this:
Thomas_Jefferson

The underscore is crucial.
