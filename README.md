# scraper
A web scraper/crawler written in Python. It is fairly simple, but oh so sweet.

#It was written in Python 2 and uses:
<ol type = "i">
<li>Beautiful Soup</li>
<li>Requests</li>
<li>PyQuery</li>
</ol>
I should note that PyQuery was used to make a mirror of the first scraper, which uses Beautiful Soup.
